  # race it: `brew upgrade` still works, and `auto_updates` keeps `greedy`
  # runs from reinstalling what the app already replaced.

  # No `depends_on macos:`. The app's floor is 10.13, which is below the
  # oldest release Homebrew itself runs on, so the constraint could only ever
  # be vacuous — and the symbol for it has been removed.
